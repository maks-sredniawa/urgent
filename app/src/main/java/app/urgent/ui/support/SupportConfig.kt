 * Everything about Help and feedback that differs from one app to the next — **the one file in
 * `ui/support/` that `scripts/sync-support.py` never overwrites.** Every other file in this package,
 * and the `shared:support` block of each `strings.xml`, comes from android-starter.
 *
 * Each constant is compiled into every build and frozen there for as long as a sideloaded copy
 * survives, so the address and the site sit on a domain we own, whose routing can move without a
 * release. The Play listing's contact field carries the same address —
 * `docs/DOD.md`, *Before the first upload*.
